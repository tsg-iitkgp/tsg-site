Everyone loves dancing. Be it in front of others or alone. At Technology Dance Society, IIT Kharagpur, we learn different dance styles to express and be out of ourselves. We are a group of enthusiastic professional dancers of this esteemed institute who represent IIT Kharagpur in various inter-collegiate dance competitions. We conduct various workshops where national level famed artists teach us. Our social media handles - Facebook (@Breakfreenowornever) and Instagram (@breakfreeiitkgp)
