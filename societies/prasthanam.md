"Drama is a combination of miserable and blissful happenings. There is drama in everyone's life.  Remember how you 'acted' you were sick when you didn't want to go to school in your childhood? There is a hidden actor in each of us whom we use at many instances of our life.  We at PRASTHANAM - Technology Dramatics Society aim to discover and  improvise the creative potential hidden in you. We are formed to integrate and perpetuate the rich dramatics heritage of the Telugu-speaking people into the mainstream of the cultural heritage of IIT Kharagpur and act as a platform for students interested in the field of dramatics to gather and exchange their thoughts with an enthusiastic & energetic team. 
There's more to dramatics rather than just acting and we intend to explore it to the maximum by indulging in innovative story writing and unique script writing along with acting.
