How you express yourself is singularly the most powerful resource you have available . At the Debating Society, IIT Kharagpur we practice structured debating to both help us with effective communication as well as strong logic. We represent IIT Kharagpur in Asian Parliamentary, British Parliamentary and Presidential (Oxford) type debates both nationally and internationally . Our sessions include workshops on the above formats as well as practice debates within society members. We have been widely successful in tournaments across the globe, achieving podium finishes at numerous places. Out of the four inter iits that have had debating, we have finished as winners three times and as runners up once making us the most successful debating society in the competition.
