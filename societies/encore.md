"Theatre as an artform is the most immediate way in which a human being can share with another the whole spectrum of human emotions. We at Encore : English Technology Dramatics Society try to push our limits as actors and reach out to the audience with our acting leaving them with everlasting memories. Across an academic year our student members take part in three full fledged productions, inter college competitions and conduct several open workshops for the entire student community.
