Spectra is the Fine Arts and Design Group of IIT Kharagpur. We are a group of creative minds that aims to bring together like-minded people on-campus who have a love for the art of form and have an interest to learn new genres of art. We conduct workshops on various forms of art traditional and modern both internally and externally. We believe in keeping our the ART culture of IIT Kharagpur alive and pass on the creative legacy to the upcoming generations. We create innovative art and craft expanding our horizon.
