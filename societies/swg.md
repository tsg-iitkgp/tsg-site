Student Welfare Group (SWG), is a student body under the office of Dean of Students’ Affairs, IIT Kharagpur. SWG works towards ensuring the smooth functioning of student’s lives on the campus by assisting students of IIT Kharagpur in developing their skills and personality. SWG provides the required resources contributing to the success of student’s college life as well as flaring productivity by organizing informatory and interactive events.
Our Group strives to contribute to the overall educational mission of the Institute by facilitating academic, emotional, social, and vocational development of the entire student community. Respect for diversity and a commitment to students’ personal growth are guiding principles in the work we do.


The Student Mentorship Programme is the flagship initiative of SWG which is held every year. This programme involves the guidance and mentorship of every single first-year student by a 3rd or 4th year student of the same department. The primary objective of this program is 
- Enabling constructive and positive interaction, guidance and mentorship of junior students by senior students. 
- Providing a reliable and comprehensive support system from within and for the student community to motivate students to excel in both academic and non-academic fields and to make the most of their life at IIT Kharagpur.
