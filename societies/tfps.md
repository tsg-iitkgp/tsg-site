"Technology Filmmaking & Photography Society is the official club of IIT Kharagpur for students interested in filmmaking, photography and film-appreciation.
Founded in 2010 by a few film enthusiasts, TFPS has come a long way in promoting filmmaking and film appreciation among the campus fraternity as well as outside. It has also been a launchpad for students interested in pursuing careers in the Entertainment Industry.
