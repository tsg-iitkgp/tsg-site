There's a little bit of "natok" in everyone. That is the thought that drives us here at Technology Dramatics Society: Druheen, the Bengali Dramatics Society of IIT Kharagpur. The ability to inspire a multitude of emotions in an audience through acting is what we practice and what we teach from the moment people enter our society. The student members conduct three full-fledged theatrical productions during the academic year performing plays written by the most famed bengali playrights from both contemporary and classical times. But our society is more than scripts, rehearsals and productions. We cherish all the "addas" post rehearsals as much as the rehearsals themselves, all the off-topic banter every time we sit down to plan and discuss any event we organise and all the struggle we share with our fellow juniors seniors and batchmates whenever we create magic onstage.
