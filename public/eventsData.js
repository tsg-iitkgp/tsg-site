                `September is here and some students are coming back to campus. This brings with it the possibility of an outbreak and hence adhering to Covid protocols is of paramount importance. To protect our community, it is required that each one of us is well aware of the rules and regulations set in place. Incoming students will have to quarantine for a minimum duration of one week. Students are advised not to leave their rooms unnecessarily, wear masks and maintain social distancing.

                To share this message, Technology Students’ Gymkhana has collaborated with Spectra to bring forward this awareness campaign. Art is captivating and has the potential to be infinitely memorable. The monthly art prompt for September is ‘Paint-demic’ with the purpose of using art to support the well being of our student community.
                
                We are looking for artworks depicting the importance of the Covid protocols, the dangers of the virus or healthy habits amidst a pandemic. The most creative artworks will be put up at various locations on campus to invigorate the spirits of students staying there and spread awareness regarding the rules set in place. The best artworks would be displayed by Gymkhana on Facebook.
                
                All sorts of artworks are appreciated, paintings, digital or traditional, sketches, posters, comics etc. Use any medium of your choice.
                Good luck to all the participants!
                Stay safe everyone!`,
